There is this yellow thing in the sky. I don't know what to make of it.
There should be a side trip into DC to Charlie Palmers during CPAC @SHannitysHair @TheFriddle @Glock4Piper @alleygirl2409
There's a bird nest in my garage and so now when the birds fly out they poop on my car. &#128529;
There's a green bowl high. A spliff high. A j high. A blunt high. A moke high. And a Moke + coffee high.
There's a special place in hell for people who slam on their brakes for yellow lights &#128532;&#128299;
 There's gonna be a lot of trash talk today
