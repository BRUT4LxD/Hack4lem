I'm not from the ghetto.
I'm not really a phone kinda guy.. I actually hate talking on the phone &amp; texting kinda trash to me also.
I'm okay with rasor talking trash
I'm such a retard sometimes.
I'm the biggest redskins dam right now if they get this stop
I've got a birds eye view of all the secrets you keep.
 I've got saltine crackers and red wine here. Is it possible to DIY a communion? I, uh, haven't been to church in awhile. #tbtweets
