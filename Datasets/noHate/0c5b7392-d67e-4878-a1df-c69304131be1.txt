I hate my dog's name.. It sounds so ghetto. &#128528;
I hate that I wake up early the morning after I drink. But the fact that there was a cold yellow gatorade in the fridge gets me so happy
I hate that wee boy wae the squinty eyes in the game of thrones. #Suchaprick #hopehegetskilled
I hate when females try to sound like bird heads
I hate yellow jackets can't feel arms and back lol
I have a feeling tonight will be trash.
I have never actually seen a yellow duck.
I have no clothes that make me look like a redneck but I tried my best &#128514;
I have really light colored eyebrows naturally and it's not ok
I have to dress up tomorrow for mock interviews and I still don't know how to tie the tie &#128530;
I hear the birds in the summer breeze; I drive fast; I am alone at midnight.
I hear the same thing day in and day out.... its for the birds.
I hope Charlie brought the lube for this test...
 I hope the Yankees get Soriano, shoulda never gave him away for Alex Rodriguez
